    "To what extent does social media addiction severity in college students predict academic performance and relationship satisfaction, and how do demographic factors such as age, gender, and relationship status moderate these effects?\n"

    "In our current time, social media has become increasingly prevalent as the world becomes more digital. Social media platforms have been ingrained in our daily lives as a means of communication, connecting, and socializing with friends, family, and peers. While these platforms facilitate connection, there has been a growing concern that heavy social media use has been connected to addictive behaviours and negative impacts on the individual and their relationships. We now see a clear reduction in face-to-face interactions, which can interfere with building friendships and relationships, and can impact mental health and academic performance through constant distraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social Media addiction can harm relationships and academic performance in many ways. Any excessive use of social media easily takes away from quality time spent with friends, loved ones, and studying. Constantly seeing curated posts from others can also create unrealistic expectations and persuade people to believe that their relationships are unsatisfactory. Instant gratification from likes or funny videos can overload dopamine levels, causing the individual to constantly seek more of such content, which can cause a nasty feedback loop, driving the user to stay on the platform or log in more frequently. Understanding these patterns can help derive strategies to combat social media addiction and help people adopt healthier habits and protect their academic and relationship success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media platforms have become deeply embedded in daily life, especially for students, serving as tools for communication, entertainment, and social connection. As usage has increased, so have concerns about problematic or addictive patterns of use and their potential impact on academic and relational outcomes. Prior research has shown that increased social media use is associated with reduced face‑to‑face interaction and higher distraction among young adults (Twenge, 2019; Kuss & Griffiths, 2017). Heavy social media use has also been linked to procrastination, attentional fragmentation, and reduced time available for studying and in‑person interactions. Excessive social media use may harm academic performance by displacing study time, fragmenting attention, and encouraging multitasking. Students who spend more hours per day on social media may experience lower grades, reduced focus, and higher stress, especially when platforms are used during study sessions or late at night. Prior work by Junco (2012) found that frequent social media use is negatively associated with academic outcomes, supporting this pattern. In the dataset we use, students report both their average daily social media usage hours and whether social media affects their academic performance, allowing us to directly examine these relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media addiction may also strain relationships. Constant exposure to curated posts can foster unrealistic expectations and social comparison, potentially lowering satisfaction with one’s own friendships or romantic relationships. Research by Appel et al. (2016) suggests that social comparison on social media can reduce relationship satisfaction and increase feelings of inadequacy. In addition, time spent online can replace face‑to‑face interactions, which may increase loneliness and conflict with friends, family, or partners. The survey we analyze includes measures of relationship satisfaction and conflict, enabling us to test whether higher social media addiction severity is associated with poorer relationship outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level may shape how social media addiction relates to academic and relational outcomes. For example, younger students or undergraduates might be more vulnerable to distraction, while gender differences in platform use and communication styles could influence relationship dynamics. Because the dataset includes information on age, gender, education level, and country, we can explore whether these factors moderate the associations between social media addiction, academic performance, and relationship satisfaction. However, because both our dataset and much of the prior literature rely on self‑reported, cross‑sectional data, causal interpretations should be made cautiously."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that higher levels of social media addiction will be associated with lower academic performance and lower relationship satisfaction among college students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Academic Performance: Students with higher social media addiction severity and greater daily social media usage will report lower academic performance. Rationale: Prior research shows that heavy social media use reduces study time, increases multitasking, and disrupts sustained attention (Junco, 2012; Kuss & Griffiths, 2017). These mechanisms suggest that students who spend more time on social media may experience lower grades, reduced focus, and higher academic strain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Satisfactinon: Higher social media addiction severity will be associated with lower relationship satisfaction and more frequent interpersonal conflict. Rationale: Social comparison, jealousy, and unrealistic expectations created by curated online content have been shown to reduce relationship satisfaction (Appel et al., 2016). Additionally, time spent online may replace in‑person interactions, increasing loneliness and conflict with friends, family, or partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moderation by Demographics: The strength of the associations between social media addiction and (a) academic performance and (b) relationship satisfaction will vary by demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level. Rationale: Younger students may be more vulnerable to distraction, and gender differences in communication styles and platform use may influence how social media affects academic and relational outcomes. Because our dataset includes age, gender, and education level, we can test whether these factors moderate the observed relationships."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
