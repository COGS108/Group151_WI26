    "In our current time, social media has become increasingly prevalent as the world becomes more digital. Social media platforms have been ingrained in our daily lives as a means of communication, connecting, and socializing with friends, family, and peers. While these platforms facilitate connection, there has been a growing concern that heavy social media use has been connected to addictive behaviours and negative impacts on the individual and their relationships. We now see a clear reduction in face-to-face interactions, which can interfere with building friendships and relationships, and can impact mental health and academic performance through constant distraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Social Media addiction can harm relationships and academic performance in many ways. Any excessive use of social media easily takes away from quality time spent with friends, loved ones, and studying. Constantly seeing curated posts from others can also create unrealistic expectations and persuade people to believe that their relationships are unsatisfactory. Instant gratification from likes or funny videos can overload dopamine levels, causing the individual to constantly seek more of such content, which can cause a nasty feedback loop, driving the user to stay on the platform or log in more frequently. Understanding these patterns can help derive strategies to combat social media addiction and help people adopt healthier habits and protect their academic and relationship success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Social media platforms have become deeply embedded in daily life, especially for students, serving as tools for communication, entertainment, and social connection. As usage has increased, so have concerns about problematic or addictive patterns of use and their potential impact on academic and relational outcomes. Prior research has shown that increased social media use is associated with reduced face‑to‑face interaction and higher distraction among young adults (Twenge, 2019; Kuss & Griffiths, 2017). Heavy social media use has also been linked to procrastination, attentional fragmentation, and reduced time available for studying and in‑person interactions.\n",
    "Excessive social media use may harm academic performance by displacing study time, fragmenting attention, and encouraging multitasking. Students who spend more hours per day on social media may experience lower grades, reduced focus, and higher stress, especially when platforms are used during study sessions or late at night. Prior work by Junco (2012) found that frequent social media use is negatively associated with academic outcomes, supporting this pattern. In the dataset we use, students report both their average daily social media usage hours and whether social media affects their academic performance, allowing us to directly examine these relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media addiction may also strain relationships. Constant exposure to curated posts can foster unrealistic expectations and social comparison, potentially lowering satisfaction with one’s own friendships or romantic relationships. Research by Appel et al. (2016) suggests that social comparison on social media can reduce relationship satisfaction and increase feelings of inadequacy. In addition, time spent online can replace face‑to‑face interactions, which may increase loneliness and conflict with friends, family, or partners. The survey we analyze includes measures of relationship satisfaction and conflict, enabling us to test whether higher social media addiction severity is associated with poorer relationship outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, demographic factors such as age, gender, and education level may shape how social media addiction relates to academic and relational outcomes. For example, younger students or undergraduates might be more vulnerable to distraction, while gender differences in platform use and communication styles could influence relationship dynamics. Because the dataset includes information on age, gender, education level, and country, we can explore whether these factors moderate the associations between social media addiction, academic performance, and relationship satisfaction. However, because both our dataset and much of the prior literature rely on self‑reported, cross‑sectional data, causal interpretations should be made cautiously.\n"

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We did not collect the data for the first dataset but the owner who owns it has a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), which means we can use the data however we like but we must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license and indicate if changes were made. We must also not do so in a way that makes it seem like the licensor endorses us or our use. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Cant really do anything about collection bias as we did not collect it but we will consider it still.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data set 1 is publicly availible and belongs to someone else\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the owner of that data deletes their data and notifies us of the deletion, we will make our move and delete that part of the data basis of our model.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There were 705 observations and out of the 705, 50/50 were female and male, 50% undergraduate and 46% graduate, 8% India response (around 56), 6% USA responses (42.3),  for countries the rest is in a category other. 705 responses from students compared to the amount of students existing seems to be a bit like a wide gap. It is unknown whether this is significant though. May need to bring in other datasets. And this may change overtime\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There may be potential data set bias as it is unknown where the 705 response came from like from instagram survey or already kaggle users etc. Not to mention it is unknown whether the country of the information matters, because if it does there is far too little for representation in one country, or can all countries just be generalized to a certain extent in terms of mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    ">But I guess we will figure this out some other time and also may potentially find a bigger dataset for when we narrow down on something else, or for further confirmation. May change over time\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    ">For Now I cannot see how our data is biased if we havent started but we will do our best to honestly represent the data by being transparent on how we get from point A to point B\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Currently data seems to be already anonymized so this may not be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> To ensure that the analysis can be generated again, for any what so ever event happens. We will do our best to write out the process step by step and say why we chose that method. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since the data has everything it needs it should be fine. We haven't made the model yet but we will try to make sure our model is not discriminatory by being transparent in the results and stating what we may have omitted and why.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We can try to see if the model makes more mistakes for one group than another but we will also use the one way Anova test to minimize errors before checking individually. Also we may end up not testing country as there is far too little data in regards to that area with respects to students in that country.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Not sure if this is relevant yet until we further test our data and sees what needs correcting for a normal distribution or something else. But if we do change metric, we will state it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes we can explain it and we will check over our github for readability at least once, Like for example, the p-values, skewness, etc and then how it lead to our next step.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes we attend to do so and also check for readability at least once, for example potential limitations of data and models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes we can make a clear plan but it is unknown if it will be followed in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> If there are users being harmed because of the model, we will contact each other and then ucsd if the model is public to see what can be done for rectification or purely for the next moves to be discussed with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes if it causes harm, we can just turn the repository private if needed or we can just either go back in history if there is anything or just plainly delete it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> To prevent unintended use, we may make the repository private but currently the only dataset is public so not much of a difference but this may change.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If it is public we can track the users to see the number of viewers if possible and then trace them down and ask for a public apology if not a rectification of their mistake if there is misuse. If it is not possible to trace, we will discuss on next moves depending on the impact\n"
