    "Social media has become deeply embedded in the daily lives of students, serving as a primary tool for communication, entertainment, and social connection. As usage has increased, researchers have raised concerns about the potential for problematic or addictive patterns of engagement. Excessive social media use has been linked to reduced face‑to‑face interaction, increased distraction, and difficulties maintaining focus on academic tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work suggests that heavy social media use may negatively affect academic performance by displacing study time, encouraging multitasking, and fragmenting attention. Students who spend more hours per day on social media often report lower grades, higher stress, and greater difficulty sustaining concentration. These patterns align with theories of attentional overload and reward‑driven behavior, where constant notifications and algorithmic reinforcement make it harder to disengage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Social media addiction has also been associated with relationship strain. Exposure to curated online content can heighten social comparison, reduce satisfaction with one’s own relationships, and increase feelings of jealousy or inadequacy. Additionally, time spent online may replace in‑person interactions, potentially weakening friendships, family relationships, or romantic partnerships. Studies have found that individuals with higher levels of social media addiction report lower relationship satisfaction and more frequent interpersonal conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "Demographic factors may further shape these outcomes. Age, gender, and education level can influence both how students use social media and how vulnerable they are to its negative effects. For example, younger students may be more susceptible to distraction, while gender differences in communication styles may affect relationship dynamics. Because our dataset includes demographic variables alongside measures of social media usage, academic impact, and relationship satisfaction, it allows us to examine not only the direct associations but also how these relationships vary across groups.

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We did not collect the data for the first dataset but the owner who owns it has a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), which means we can use the data however we like but we must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license and indicate if changes were made. We must also not do so in a way that makes it seem like the endorses us or our use. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "> Data set 1 is publicly availible and belongs to someone else\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> There were 705 observations and out of the 705, 50/50 were female and male, 50% undergraduate and 46% graduate, 8% India response (around 56), 6% USA responses (42.3),  for countries the rest is in a category other. 705 responses from students compared to the amount of students existing seems to be a bit like a wide gap. It is unknown whether this is significant though. May need to bring in other datasets. And this may change overtime \n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> There may be potential data set bias as it is unknown where the 705 response came from like from instagram survey ir already kaggle users etc. Not to mention it is unknown whether the country of the information matters, because if it does there is far too little for representation in one country, or can all countries just be generalized to a certain extent in terms of mental health. \n",
    "But I guess we will figure this out some other time and also may potentially find a bigger dataset for when we narrow down on something else, or for further confirmation. May change over time\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "> Currently data seems to be already anonymized so this may not be affected.\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
